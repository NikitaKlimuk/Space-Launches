# Space Launch React App

This project is a React-based web application that uses the Launch Library 2 API to display information about space shuttle launches and beyond. Users can view detailed information about a particular launch.

Preview: [space-launches-gamma.vercel.app](https://space-launches-gamma.vercel.app/)

## Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies:

`Typescript`
`React`
`Redux`
`Redux-toolkit`
`React Router`
`React Paginate`
`SCSS`

## Timing
The project was completed in a short and fixed amount of time (4 hours)
With more time, I would devote my attention to improving the next points:
- Adding filtering (react hook form connection)
- A HERO section on the home page (before the pagination) with a picture of the rocket launch and a small description of the project.
- More detailed work with typo.
- Adding components in case of errors from the server.
- Create media file for full optimization for all devices.
- More detailed work with styles and dark theme.
- Extension of details page (output more information about launching).
- Improvement of skeleton styles

## Install dependencies with npm install
Start the application with **npm start**
